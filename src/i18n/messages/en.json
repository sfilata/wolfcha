      "werewolf": "<role_tips>\n- Kill priority: Seer > Witch > Hunter > Guard > threatening villagers\n- Fake claim timing: consider fake-claiming seer after the real one is exposed to split good players' focus\n- Stance tricks: moderately shade teammates to create division, but protect them in key votes\n- Speech strategy: don't be too quiet or too aggressive; keep a natural rhythm\n- Vote traps: avoid wolves voting together and exposing the wolf pit; scatter votes\n- Dodge awareness: if you're in good shape, let teammates draw attention first\n- Death info: if someone died at night, react to the cause in your speech\n</role_tips>",
      "seer": "<role_tips>\n- Reveal timing: if first check is wolf, consider revealing day 1 to lead; if good, observe first\n- Report order: report wolves before good players for higher info value\n- First check strategy: check edge seats or suspicious speakers; avoid obvious good players\n- Counter-claim: ask opponent to report first; check if their logic is sound\n- Self-protection: you're the top wolf target; hint for guard protection\n- Last words prep: if you feel death coming, prepare your check report\n- Death info: if someone died at night, react to the cause in your speech\n</role_tips>",
      "witch": "<role_tips>\n- First night potion: usually don't save night 1 unless the target is clearly a key role\n- Antidote rule: save confirmed good or key roles; don't save unknown identities\n- Poison timing: save for confirmed wolves; don't poison impulsively\n- Info hiding: don't easily reveal your potion usage; it's valuable info\n- Self-save rule: remember you cannot self-save; if knifed, you die\n- Stance value: you know who was knifed; this is a key clue for wolf reads\n- Death info: if someone died at night, react to the cause in your speech\n</role_tips>",
      "hunter": "<role_tips>\n- Shoot timing: on death, shoot a confirmed wolf\n- Fake identity: you can bait with fake claims, but don't reveal too early\n- Poison rule: if poisoned by witch, you cannot shoot; note this limit\n- Last words value: if voted out, you can shoot after last words\n- Deterrence: wolves know you're hunter and will hesitate; use this\n- Survival awareness: your shot is valuable; try to live to a key moment\n- Death info: if someone died at night, react to the cause in your speech\n</role_tips>",
      "guard": "<role_tips>\n- Protection priority: Seer > Witch > other key roles > key good players\n- Consecutive protection: cannot protect the same player two nights in a row; plan ahead\n- Read the knife: judge who wolves will knife tonight based on the situation\n- Empty knife judgment: if your target didn't die, wolves may have knifed someone else\n- Info hiding: don't easily reveal who you protected; it's valuable info\n- Coordinate with seer: if seer revealed, prioritize protecting them\n- Death info: if someone died at night, react to the cause in your speech\n</role_tips>",
      "villager": "<role_tips>\n- Listening skills: listen carefully to everyone; find contradictions and tells\n- Stance timing: take a stance after enough info; don't blindly follow\n- Vote coordination: follow key roles' vote calls to form vote advantages\n- Speech value: as a villager, speak actively and share your reads\n- Vote caution: don't easily vote someone without evidence\n- Read the situation: understand the current wolf vs good count\n- Death info: if someone died at night, react to the cause in your speech\n</role_tips>"
